# CodettaChat

This is a ChatBot and messaging app that I created with Python for the GenCyber CyberSecurity camp.

## To Use

First, clone the project.
Then, you'll need to run the server.py file with `py server.py`, and it'll start the server and tell you what IP it is on.
Now, anyone that wants to join will need to run the client.py file with `py client.py`, and it will ask them for a host, which is the IP the server is being hosted on, and a port, which is 33000. The next thing they'll see is a Python window pop up, asking them for their name. After they enter it, it will welcome them to the server, and anyone else on it can see them. Any message they send will be sent to their personal ChatBot, and to anyone else that is logged on.

If you're here from the CMU 112 TA's, hey ðŸ‘‹ :)
